## What is color theory and why is it important?
 
Color theory is the study of how colors interact with each other and with human perception. Color theory helps us understand how to use colors effectively in art, design, communication, and other fields. Color theory can help us create harmonious, attractive, and meaningful color schemes that convey our intended message and mood.
 
Color theory is based on some fundamental concepts, such as:
 
- The color wheel: a circular diagram that shows the relationships between primary, secondary, and tertiary colors.
- The color model: a system that defines how colors are represented in different media, such as RGB (red, green, blue) for digital screens, CMYK (cyan, magenta, yellow, black) for printing, or HSL (hue, saturation, lightness) for web design.
- The color harmony: a set of rules or guidelines that help us choose colors that work well together and create a pleasing effect.
- The color psychology: a branch of psychology that studies how colors affect human emotions, behavior, and cognition.
